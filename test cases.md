### âœ… **1. Basic Matching Cases**
| Case | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Student has exactly 3 required electives (including main) | Program qualifies |
| Student has more than 3 electives including main | Best combination used |
| Student has 3 electives but missing main | Program rejected |
| Student has no track subjects at all | Program rejected |
| Student has all track electives but fewer than 3 | Program rejected |

---

### âœ… **2. Elective Track Variants**
| Structure | What to test |
|----------|--------------|
| `main` + `subs` | Main must be present, + 2 from subs |
| `main` + `tracks` with grouped electives | Ensure one per group is picked, no duplicates from same group |
| `tracks` without a main | Program qualifies if all groups are covered with any 3 subjects |
| Flexible track names like `"General Science"` or `"Business"` | Student's program group should not affect logic (unless itâ€™s explicitly used) |

---

### âœ… **3. Grade Logic (Once You Re-enable It)**
| Case | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Student meets subject criteria but exceeds cutoff | Rejected |
| Student matches subjects and meets cutoff | Qualified |
| Best 6 grades used | Confirm aggregate is calculated correctly |
| Edge cases like ties (e.g. two subjects with same grade) | Still selects best total |

---

### âœ… **4. Campus Logic**
| Case | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Obuasi campus programs without subjects | Always qualify if within cutoff |
| Obuasi + Main program exists | Ensure both can qualify separately |
| Student qualifies for main but not Obuasi (or vice versa) | Results should reflect that |

---

### âœ… **5. Frontend UX Cases**
| Case | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Student enters fewer than 4 electives | Block submit or show error |
| Student selects duplicate electives | Prevent or warn user |
| Program list updates dynamically | After matching logic, correct results displayed |
| Console logs helpful debug info | Useful in dev mode only |
| LocalStorage cleared & reloaded | App behaves gracefully |

---

### âœ… **6. Data Consistency**
| Scenario | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| JSON has malformed subject groups (e.g. typo like `"Chemsitry"`) | Should fail gracefully or log warning |
| JSON has `"main": null` | Still process tracks normally |
| Unexpected elective name in student data | Shouldnâ€™t crash logic, just ignore it |

---

### âœ… **7. API / Data Handling**
If you plan to expand this later:
- Simulate large numbers of users (1000+ records)
- LocalStorage + async saving logic stress test
- Browser refreshes in the middle of processing
- Save/Load across sessions

---

### ðŸ§ª Bonus: Automated Testing Ideas
If you're adding test coverage:
- Unit tests for `checkMainRequirements`, `generateValidElectiveCombinations`, `calculateQualifyingPrograms`
- Mock user data in various structures
- Snapshot UI tests for results display

---

### ðŸš€ Once All These Pass...
- âœ… You're safe to deploy a **Beta Version**
- ðŸ’¡ Add a "Report Error" button so users can flag issues
- ðŸŽ“ Use real feedback to refine your recommendation engine

yasante7: Check all the relevant files and suggest all test cases to make sure my app is ready to be deployed

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationHere are the test cases derived from the provided workspace files to ensure your app is ready for deployment:

---

### **1. Core Logic Tests**
#### program-checker.ts
- **`checkMainRequirements`**
  - Test with `null`, single string, and array inputs.
  - Ensure it correctly identifies valid and invalid main requirements.
  - Handle nested arrays in `main` gracefully.
- **`generateValidElectiveCombinations`**
  - Test with various combinations of `main` and `tracks`.
  - Ensure no duplicate subjects in combinations.
  - Validate that combinations meet the required number of subjects.
- **`calculateQualifyingPrograms`**
  - Test with:
    - Programs with no subject requirements (e.g., Obuasi campus).
    - Programs with valid and invalid elective combinations.
    - Programs with missing or malformed data.
  - Ensure correct qualification status and valid combinations are returned.
  - Verify that cutoff points are respected.

---

### **2. Frontend UX Tests**
#### page.tsx
- Ensure qualifying programs are displayed correctly.
- Verify that programs are filtered by campus (e.g., "Main Campus" vs. "Obuasi Campus").
- Check that aggregate points and cutoff points are displayed accurately.
- Test error handling when `localStorage` data is missing or corrupted.
- Ensure the "Edit Grades" button navigates correctly.

#### page.tsx
- Verify that logs are captured and displayed in real-time.
- Ensure progress updates dynamically during program checking.
- Test that console overrides (`console.log`, `console.error`) work as expected.

#### page.tsx
- Test navigation from the landing page to the registration flow.
- Ensure all UI elements (e.g., buttons, links) are functional and styled correctly.

---

### **3. Data Consistency Tests**
#### programdatan.json
- Validate JSON structure:
  - Ensure all programs have required fields (`program`, `campus`, `college`, etc.).
  - Check for malformed subject groups or typos (e.g., `"Chemsitry"`).
- Test with missing or `null` values in `main` or `tracks`.
- Ensure unexpected elective names in student data do not crash the app.

---

### **4. LocalStorage Tests**
- Verify that `qualifyingPrograms` and `userData` are saved and loaded correctly.
- Test behavior when `localStorage` is cleared or contains invalid data.
- Ensure data persists across browser sessions.

---

### **5. Grade Logic Tests**
- Ensure aggregate points are calculated correctly using the best 6 grades.
- Test edge cases like ties (e.g., two subjects with the same grade).
- Verify that exceeding the cutoff point disqualifies a program.

---

### **6. Campus Logic Tests**
- Ensure Obuasi campus programs always qualify if within the cutoff.
- Verify that programs with the same name but different campuses qualify independently.

---

### **7. Performance and Stress Tests**
- Simulate large numbers of users (e.g., 1000+ records in `localStorage`).
- Test async saving/loading logic under heavy load.
- Verify app behavior during browser refreshes in the middle of processing.

---

### **8. API / Data Handling Tests**
- Test integration with supabase.ts (if re-enabled).
- Simulate API failures and ensure the app handles them gracefully.
- Verify that data is saved and retrieved correctly from the backend.

---

### **9. Automated Testing Ideas**
- Unit tests for:
  - `checkMainRequirements`
  - `generateValidElectiveCombinations`
  - `calculateQualifyingPrograms`
- Mock user data in various structures for testing.
- Snapshot tests for UI components (e.g., `GradesSuccessPage`).

---

### **10. Bonus: Deployment Readiness**
- Ensure all console logs are removed or disabled in production.
- Verify that the app works across different browsers and devices.
- Add a "Report Error" button for user feedback.
